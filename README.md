# [Giorgio e Benni](http://giorgioebenni.herokuapp.com/) - Wedding website
The website I used for my wedding!

## Idea ##
Back-end: a basic Flask application with minimal database management (will do).
Front-end: based on Html5, CSS and Javascript and [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

I started from a super basic template, [this](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/navbar-fixed/), and then I added some front-end features e a few of back-end.

## Usage ##
Set up the environment variables `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD` and start `app.py` with python.

The site launch was designed to be deployed with Heroku
